cache.py — Stock data cache layer (Week 1)

Problem this solves:
  load_stock_data() calls yf.download() on every invocation.  The WebSocket
  broadcaster was doing this every second per ticker, which hammers Yahoo
  Finance and blocks the event loop (yfinance is synchronous).

Solution:
  get_or_fetch_candles() wraps load_stock_data() with a Redis cache.
  On a cache hit  → instant return from Redis (< 1 ms).
  On a cache miss → yfinance fetch runs in a thread-pool executor so it
                    doesn't block the async event loop, then the result is
                    stored in Redis with a TTL tuned to each interval.

TTL rationale:
  A 1-minute candle only changes every ~60 s, so caching it for 20 s is safe.
  A daily candle changes once per trading day, so 30 min is fine.
  Shorter TTLs keep the data fresh; longer TTLs reduce API pressure.

Redis key format:  stock:data:{ticker}:{interval}:{period}
Stored value:      JSON list of candle dicts (time, open, high, low, close, buy_price)
